# Multistate

### Article
This Python package implements the results of my article on [stochastic gene expression with multistate promoters](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/18M1181006). It aims at efficiently computing the analytical stationary distribution for a large class of refractory promoters, as well as performing exact stochastic simulations in both standard (SSA) and hybrid (PDMP) formalisms.

### Demo
The [tutorials](https://github.com/ulysseherbach/multistate/tree/master/tutorials) folder contains a basic demo script showing what the `multistate` package does along with various examples.

### Dependencies
The package depends on the following standard scientific libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `mpmath`.
